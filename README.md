## Contents of the ZIP Folder

This ZIP folder contains the following items:

1. `yolov8n` - Fine-tuned yolov8n model files. (with script)
2. `yolov8x` - Fine-tuned yolov8x model files. (with script)
3. `ws-test` - srcipt and weights 
4. `best8n.mp4` - Video demonstrating the fine-tuned model performance.
5. `yolov8n.mp4` - Video showing yolov8n model performance without fine-tuning.
6. `yolov8x.mp4` - Video showing yolov8x model performance without fine-tuning.
7. `report.docx` - Detailed report and analysis of the models.


## Detailed Description

### yolov8n Folder
This folder contains results from fine-tuning the yolov8n model on the NOD dataset. It includes various files such as performance curves and prediction images. Key highlights include the normalized confusion matrix and the Precision-Recall curve, detailed explanations for which can be found in the `report.docx`.

### yolov8x Folder
Similar to the yolov8n folder, this contains results from fine-tuning the yolov8x model on the NOD dataset.

### ws-test Folder
this folder contain script and weights for testing the fine-tuned model and comparing it with alredy exist model. 

### Video Demonstrations
There are three videos demonstrating the testing of three models under extreme low light conditions. The confidence score is set over 10% but is automatically updated as the confidence changes, and you can read it above the bounding box.

1. **best8n.mp4**: Shows the performance of the fine-tuned model.
